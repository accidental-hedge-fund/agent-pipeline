# agent-pipeline

A label-driven pipeline that advances a GitHub issue (or a PR's linked issue)
through an 11-stage state machine to `pipeline:ready-to-deploy` — planning →
plan-review → implementing → review → fix → pre-merge → eval-gate. It does **not**
auto-merge; you own the merge button.

It ships as a skill for **both Claude Code (`/pipeline`) and Codex (`$pipeline`)**
from a single shared TypeScript core. The two hosts differ only by a small
JSON **profile** (who implements vs. reviews, naming, review mode) — there is no
forked pipeline logic.

```
backlog → ready → planning → plan-review → implementing
              → review-1 → fix-1 → review-2 → fix-2
              → pre-merge → eval-gate → ready-to-deploy
```

## Prerequisites

The pipeline is **cross-harness** — each run uses one CLI to implement and the
*other* to review. So both are required regardless of which host you install:

- **Node ≥ 24** with **`npm`** (npm ships with Node and installs the core's deps — commander, js-yaml, zod). The core runs TypeScript directly via native type-stripping; no build step.
- **`git`** and **`gh`** on PATH, with `gh auth status` authenticated against the target repo.
- **Both `claude` and `codex` CLIs** on PATH and **authenticated** (logged in) — each run uses one to implement and the other to review.
- **Review runs on the *other* harness, invoked directly** (symmetric — `/pipeline`
  reviews with `codex`, `$pipeline` reviews with `claude`). The default
  `reviewMode: prompt-harness` calls the reviewer CLI with the pipeline's own
  review prompt, which returns a structured JSON verdict against
  `review-output.schema.json` (review-1 = standard, review-2 = adversarial). **No
  review plugin is required** — you just need the other harness's CLI installed and
  authenticated (listed above).
  - *Optional companion review modes* (`codex-companion` / `claude-companion`) drive
    the reviewer through a 3rd-party plugin instead — `codex-plugin-cc`
    (`/codex:review`) for Codex, `cc-plugin-codex` (`$cc:review`) for Claude — using
    each harness's native review feature, run read-only/sandboxed. They are **not**
    the default and **not** required; set `reviewMode` in the profile to opt in.
    Override companion paths with `PIPELINE_CODEX_COMPANION` / `PIPELINE_CC_COMPANION`.
- `~/.agent-operating-contract.md` and a per-repo conventions file: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude/OpenClaw) or `AGENTS.md` (Codex).
- **Optional: the [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) CLI** (`npm i -g @fission-ai/openspec`) — only for repos that opt into the OpenSpec flow (see "OpenSpec integration (optional)"). Not needed otherwise.
- No API keys — LLM budget comes from your `claude` / `codex` subscriptions.

The installer prints a prerequisite checklist (warnings don't block install).

## Install

> Public repo under the `accidental-hedge-fund` org — the methods below need no
> special access.

### One command, both hosts (recommended)

```bash
npx github:accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline install            # detects ~/.claude and ~/.codex; installs to each present host
# or a specific host:
npx github:accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline install --host claude
npx github:accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline install --host codex
```

Or clone and run directly:

```bash
gh repo clone accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline
node agent-pipeline/scripts/install.mjs install        # --host claude|codex|all  (default all)
```

The installer copies the shared core + the right host overlay into
`~/.claude/skills/pipeline` and/or `~/.codex/skills/pipeline`, writes a launcher
shim, and pre-installs the core's dependencies. It honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
and `CODEX_HOME`. **Restart Codex** after a Codex install; Claude picks it up live.

#### Claude as the primary harness (`/pipeline`)

This is the Claude-primary flow: **Claude Code implements, Codex reviews.**

```bash
npx github:accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline install --host claude   # this pipeline skill
codex login                                            # the reviewer — review invokes `codex` directly
```

By default (`reviewMode: prompt-harness`) review invokes the `codex` CLI directly with a
JSON-returning prompt — **no review plugin needed**, just the authenticated `codex` CLI.
*(Optional: to use Codex's native review via the `codex-plugin-cc` companion instead, set
`reviewMode: codex-companion` and run `/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc` then
`/plugin install codex@openai-codex`.)*

#### Codex as the primary harness (`$pipeline`)

This is the Codex-primary flow: **Codex implements, Claude Code reviews.**

```bash
npx github:accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline install --host codex   # this pipeline skill
claude auth login                                      # the reviewer — review invokes `claude` directly
```

By default (`reviewMode: prompt-harness`) review invokes the `claude` CLI directly with a
JSON-returning prompt — **no review plugin needed**, just the authenticated `claude` CLI. Then
restart Codex and run `$pipeline N`. *(Optional: to use Claude Code's native review via the
`cc-plugin-codex` companion instead, set `reviewMode: claude-companion` and run `npx cc-plugin-codex install`.)*

### Claude Code — plugin marketplace (versioned, auto-updatable)

```
/plugin marketplace add accidental-hedge-fund/agent-pipeline
/plugin install pipeline@ahf-tools
```

This installs the same skill as a plugin (`/pipeline`, shown as `pipeline:pipeline`).
If you have a personal install at `~/.claude/skills/pipeline`, the installer detects
it automatically and offers to relocate it to a timestamped backup — no data is lost.
In interactive terminals you will be prompted; in non-interactive environments (CI,
piped `npx`) the relocation happens automatically. If you declined the prompt or need
to re-run, use the installer directly:

```
node scripts/install.mjs install --host claude
```

Update later with `/plugin marketplace update ahf-tools`.

## Usage

```
/pipeline N            $pipeline N            advance loop (default; up to 12 transitions)
/pipeline N --status   $pipeline N --status   read-only: stage, blocker, PR, last review
/pipeline N --unblock "<answer>"              post answer + clear the blocked label
/pipeline N --once                            advance one stage and stop
/pipeline N --dry-run                         log only; no harness calls, no GitHub writes
/pipeline --cleanup    $pipeline --cleanup    sweep merged-PR worktrees, then exit (no number)
```

The number is auto-detected as an issue or PR. PRs resolve to their linked
closing issue; PRs with no `Closes #N` are refused. Items must carry a
`pipeline:*` label (opt-in) — add `pipeline:ready` to start.

`--cleanup` takes no number: it sweeps pipeline-managed worktrees under
`worktree_root` whose PR is already merged, removing the worktree and its local
branch. It only touches `pipeline/<N>-<slug>` worktrees, never the remote branch,
and skips (reporting the reason) any worktree with uncommitted changes or a local
HEAD that differs from the merged PR's commit. It is idempotent — a second run
finds nothing to do.

# `harnesses:` here is accepted for back-compat but IGNORED — the install profile owns it.
```

## Configurable steps (optional)

The `steps` block turns the optional "thoroughness" steps on or off per repo, to
trade rigor for speed. Default is everything on (the full pipeline). Configurable:
`plan_review`, `standard_review` (review-1 + its fix round), `adversarial_review`
(review-2 + its fix round), and `docs`. Disabling a step still yields a valid path
to `ready-to-deploy`, and each skip is recorded as a transition comment on the issue.

The structural and safety steps — planning, implementing, and the pre-merge **CI**
and **mergeability** gates — are **not** configurable: they have no toggle, and an
unknown key under `steps` (e.g. `mergeability: false`) is rejected at config-parse
time rather than silently dropping a safety gate.

## Test/build gate (optional, default on)

When `test_gate.enabled` (the default), the target repo's **own** test/build
command runs inside the worktree during implementation and **after each fix
round**, before a PR is opened or the item advances. If it fails, the implementer
harness gets the failure output and retries in a **bounded generate→test→fix
loop** — up to `max_attempts` fix invocations (default 3), each test run capped at
`timeout` seconds (default 300). The item never opens a PR or advances while the
command is failing; persistent failure → `blocked` with the captured output
surfaced on the issue. This catches broken changes locally instead of waiting for
CI after review.

The command is **auto-detected** (first match wins):

1. explicit `test_gate.command` override (parsed without a shell)
2. `package.json` — a real `test` script (npm placeholder/`echo` stubs skipped),
   else a `build:check` / `typecheck` / `type-check` / `build` script; the package
   manager follows the lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm, `yarn.lock` → yarn, else npm)
3. `go.mod` → `go test ./...`
4. `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`
5. pytest — only with a concrete marker (`pytest.ini`, root `conftest.py`, or a
   `[tool.pytest*]` section in `pyproject.toml`); `pyproject.toml` alone is **not**
   enough
6. `Makefile` with a `test:` target → `make test`

**Repos with no detectable command (and no override) are skipped entirely** — zero
behavior change. For monorepos or custom runners, set `test_gate.command`
explicitly. **Rollback** is a one-line `test_gate: { enabled: false }` — no labels,
no state-machine changes.

### Matching CI: set `test_gate.command` when CI does more than `npm test`

Auto-detection picks the package `test` script (or equivalent). If your CI also
runs additional steps — a generated-artifact sync check, a typecheck pass, an
install smoke-test — the gate will miss those steps and a CI-only failure can
escape to pre-merge.

**Fix:** add a script that chains all CI steps and point the gate at it:

```yaml
# .github/pipeline.yml
test_gate:
  command: "npm run ci"   # wraps the full CI command sequence (see package.json)
```

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "ci:core": "(cd core && npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm test)",
  "ci": "npm run ci:core && node scripts/build.mjs --check && npm run ci:install-smoke",
  "ci:install-smoke": "node scripts/ci-install-smoke.mjs"
}
```

`test_gate.command` is parsed **without a shell** (whitespace-tokenized, then
spawned directly). Compound operators like `&&` must live inside the script body
(where npm/shell handles them), not raw in the config value.

## Eval gate (optional, default off)

When `eval_gate.enabled` (default **off**), the target repo's eval harness runs
**after pre-merge, before `ready-to-deploy`**, inside the issue's worktree. It's a
one-time opt-in per repo: set `enabled: true` and a `command`. The command runs
through `sh -c` (so pipes, `&&`, and env vars work) and its **exit code alone**
decides pass/fail — the pipeline never parses scores. The outcome (PASS/FAIL, mode,
elapsed, output excerpt) is always recorded as an issue comment.

- **`mode: gate`** (default) — a non-zero exit **blocks** the item.
- **`mode: advisory`** — the result is recorded and the item **always advances**,
  even after retries are exhausted.
- A failing run is retried up to `max_attempts` (default 2; `1` = no retry),
  short-circuiting on the first pass.
- `timeout` (default 300) is a **hard stage-level budget in seconds, shared across
  all attempts**, so total wall-time never exceeds it.
- **Tooling failures always block, regardless of mode** — if the command times out
  or can't be spawned (missing binary, etc.) the harness itself couldn't run, so the
  item is blocked even in advisory mode.

When disabled (the default), pre-merge advances straight to `ready-to-deploy` and
the `eval-gate` label is never applied — zero behavior change and no extra comment.
**Rollback** is `eval_gate: { enabled: false }` (the default).

## OpenSpec integration (optional)

If a target repo uses [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev/) (it has an `openspec/`
directory), the pipeline runs a spec-first flow:

- **Planning** — instead of a freeform plan, the implementer authors an OpenSpec
  change (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, spec deltas) under `openspec/changes/<id>/`,
  which the *other* harness plan-reviews as intent before any code is written. The
  change is validated structurally (`openspec validate <id>`) at draft and after
  revision, and implementation works the change's `tasks.md`.
- **Review** — the change's spec deltas are fed into the standard and adversarial
  review prompts as the intended behavior, so reviews check whether the diff
  actually satisfies the spec, not just whether the code looks correct.
- **Finalize (pre-merge)** — folds the change into the living specs
  (`openspec archive`, committed to the PR), then runs `openspec validate --all`
  and refuses `pipeline:ready-to-deploy` if anything is structurally invalid.

It's **auto-detected** by default (`openspec.enabled: auto`); set it to `on` to
require OpenSpec everywhere or `off` to disable. By default the pipeline only uses
OpenSpec on repos that already have it; set `openspec.bootstrap: true` to have
**planning run `openspec init`** (committed to the PR) on repos that lack an
`openspec/` workspace. The `openspec` CLI must be on PATH — if it's missing the
pre-merge gate is skipped (non-blocking) and planning blocks with an install hint.
No `openspec/` dir (and no bootstrap) means no behavior change, so the pipeline
stays usable on any repo.

## last30days context (optional)

When `last30days.enabled: true`, a **pre-planning** step runs the
[last30days skill](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill) against the issue
title and carries the resulting brief forward: it's posted as a
`## Pre-Planning Context — last30days` issue comment **and** injected into the
planning prompt, so the plan is written with recent public discourse (Reddit, X,
YouTube, HN, GitHub, …) in hand.

**Default off**, and best suited to product/strategy/named-topic issues — a typical
pure-code issue title returns little public signal. It's also **always
non-blocking**: if the skill isn't installed, the interpreter is missing, the run
fails, or the brief has no signal, planning proceeds without it. The pipeline reads
no API keys itself — the skill owns its own env/keys. Requires the `last30days`
skill installed (`/plugin marketplace add mvanhorn/last30days-skill` in Claude Code,
or `npx skills add mvanhorn/last30days-skill -g` for Codex/CLI hosts; resolved from
`$LAST30DAYS_SKILL_DIR`, `~/.claude/skills/last30days`, or `~/.codex/skills/last30days`)
and Python 3.12+.

**Data-source keys** are configured in the skill, not this pipeline. The two
highest-lift keys are `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` (free [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/))
and `SCRAPECREATORS_API_KEY` (fuller social/X coverage). Without any keys the
skill still runs on free public sources, but adding keys improves signal
significantly. See the [skill's setup guide](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill#setup)
for full instructions.

## How the two hosts share one core

`core/scripts/profile.ts` loads `core/profiles/<name>.json`; the shim passes
`--profile claude` or `--profile codex`. The profile sets the only things that
differ between hosts:

| | Claude | Codex |
|---|---|---|
| invocation | `/pipeline` | `$pipeline` |
| implementer / reviewer | claude / codex | codex / claude |
| review mode | `prompt-harness` (default) | `prompt-harness` (default) |
| reviewer (direct, JSON prompt) | `codex` CLI | `claude` CLI |
| conventions file | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |

Everything else — stages, prompts, GitHub I/O, worktrees, locking — is one
shared implementation. Inverting behavior is a JSON edit, not a code change.

## Uninstall

```bash
node scripts/install.mjs uninstall --host all      # or claude | codex
# plugin install:
/plugin uninstall pipeline@ahf-tools
```

## Development

```bash
cd core && npm ci && npm test     # 189 tests, node --test
node scripts/build.mjs            # regenerate plugin/ after editing core or the Claude overlay
node scripts/build.mjs --check    # CI gate: fail if committed plugin/ is stale
npm run ci                        # run the full CI command (tests + build check + install smoke)
```

After changing anything under `core/` or `hosts/claude/SKILL.md`, re-run
`build.mjs` and commit the regenerated `plugin/` (CI enforces this).
